Add ruleset raw links to `source.txt`, Then run `Actions`. Next, you will see the generated `*.json` file in the `rule_json` directory and the generated `*.srs` file in the `rule_srs` directory. They can all be used by sing-box. It is recommended to use `*.srs` files as they perform more smoothly than `*.json` files. Since these file formats are only supported in newer versions of sing-box, please install sing-box version 1.8.0‚Å∫ on your device For details, please refer to [sing-box official document](https://sing-box.sagernet.org).
